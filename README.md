# Blogs-with-DB-Posts-and-User-Auth
A full stack website, which allows users to register for an account, and then log in, allowing them to create posts with a title and body, saving them to a MySQL databse. Posts can then be edited or delted. Users can view all posts, and filter them by poster, or title. Created using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL.
